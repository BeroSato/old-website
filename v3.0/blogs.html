            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>so, I have finally finished the development of this website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>and now i'm planning to make some UWP apps and a game with C#</p>
            <br>
            <p>i'm currently learning JavaScript for fun, and i'm going to learn C# after that, there the development of stuff I dreamed for would start. :)</p>
            <h4>The Kart Racing Game</h4>
            <p>until I finish making some UWP apps, i'm also planning to make my own racing game that might come with PS1 style and a lot of levels and it might get multiplayer mode as well (hopefully)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Note that the game name might get changed if I find a better name. (feel free to suggest a new name for it in my twitter page)</p>

                1. I know that I said I will use javascript in the future versions, well, I didn't since the thing I actually wanted to use with javascript looked weird so I ended up not using it. <br>
                2. As you know, this is the final version of my website finally, I can work with other projects I wanted to make but it isn't mean the end! I might improve the website someday if I wanted to. :)

            <p>I Have been working on this website for almost 1 month now,
                I have been thinking a lot about what I should add, for now until I finish learning JavaScript,
                The final touchs I will do for this website is: <br>
                1. mobile menu for the header <br>
                2. Blogs page for the website <br>
                Hopefully I will be able to do these and the last version number will be 2.0 (newer versions will be just a
                fix for stuff). :)</p>
